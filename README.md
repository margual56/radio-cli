# radio-cli
A simple radio CLI written in rust.

**NEW**: Now it can search for any radio station! Just select the "Other" option to be prompted for the search.

### Warning! (**DEPENDENCIES**)
- *Needed*: `mpv` is called to play the audio/video. (See the [How it works](https://github.com/margual56/radio-cli#how-it-works) section).
- *Optional dependency*: To play youtube music you need to have `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` installed! 

## Contributing and code of conduct
Please, take a look at the [Contributing](https://github.com/margual56/radio-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/margual56/radio-cli/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guidelines

## Usage
To use it, just type `radio-cli` after installing it and the program will guide you.

When playing music, __you can use the mpv keybindings__ to control it (spacebar to play/pause, etc).

You can add a country to your config (optional) and search for any radio station!

# Installation
- On Arch (and derivatives such as Manjaro), you can just install it through [the AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=radio-cli-bin) called **radio-cli-bin**. If you have an AUR helper:
```bash
$ yay -S radio-cli-bin
```
_Note: radio-cli-git is now unsupported_

- On other systems you can:
   - Install it manually, without automatic update capabilities:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/margual56/radio-cli.git radio-cli
      cd radio-cli
      cargo build --release
      sudo cp "./target/release/radio-cli" "/usr/bin/radio"
      mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/radio-cli/"
      cp "./config.json" "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/radio-cli/"
      ```
   - Install it through cargo: `cargo install --git https://github.com/margual56/radio-cli`

## How it works...
...is very simple. The idea is to have a compilation of radio stations in [the config file](https://github.com/margual56/radio-cli/blob/main/config.json) and have a tool to be able to easily select one or the other.

The rest is thanks to the **wonderful** and **amazing** [mpv player](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv). mpv is the one that does all the heavy-lifting and plays whatever you throw at it.

Let's say this is just a cli frontend for playing things on mpv ðŸ˜„, kinda like [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli) but without search functionalities and focused on radio stations.

If the station you want was not defined in the config, you will be able to search for it!

## Configurability
As said before, this app is just a compilation of radios + a search prompt for online radios. It can be found in [the config file](https://github.com/margual56/radio-cli/blob/main/config.json) as a JSON, with a list of station names and their URLs.


Of course you can add literally WHATEVER you want, even youtube videos (again, all thanks to mpv).
</details>

Otherwise, you can just use the online search functionality.

## Fork me!
If you (wrongfully xD) think mpv is not the best player, go ahead, fork me and change it :)

The license is GPLv2

## Planned features 
Don't be surprised if these are not implemented in the end hehe (if there is no interest in the project, certainly not)

- [x] ~Audio (mpv) controls when not in verbose mode~
- [ ] Loop to selection list when pressing `q` while playing
- [x] ~Some kind of online updating of the list of stations~ _(kind of)_
- [x] ~Code optimizations/beautification~
- [x] ~Search international online radios~
- Languages:
  - [x] ~English~
  - [ ] Spanish
  - [ ] Others(?)
- [x] ~An AUR installer~

# Honorable mentions
- A **BIG** thank you to the amazing developer/s of [Radio Browser](https://www.radio-browser.info/) and its wonderful [API](http://api.radio-browser.info/) and [rust library](https://crates.io/crates/radiobrowser).
